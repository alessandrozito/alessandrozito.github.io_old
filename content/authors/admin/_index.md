I am a third year Ph.D. student in Statistics at [Duke University](https://stat.duke.edu/), in North Carolina. Prior to joining the United States in 2019, I studied Economics at [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home/programs/bachelor+of+science/economic+and+social+sciences), in Milan, Italy. 

My current line of work is strongly **motivated by application**, which serves as a base for **developing new statistical methodologies**. At Duke, I am working under the supervision of Professor [David Dunson](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=KwEOawwAAAAJ&hl=en) with [LIFEPLAN](https://www2.helsinki.fi/en/projects/lifeplan), an international research group whose aim is to quantify biodiversity across the globe. In my most recent paper, I develop **BayesANT**  (*Bayes*i*a*n *N*onparametric *T*axonomic classifier) a taxonomic classification model for insect DNA. Read about it on [ArXiv]( https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09782) and try the [R package]( https://alessandrozito.github.io/BayesANT/vignette.html)!
 
Besides Statistics, my biggest passions are boxing and painting. Check out my gallery of paintings [here](https://www.instagram.com/alezitoart/)!
